# WordAfterWord
A simple word-based game that allows you to shorten your time in console. Written in Java, really simple, but addictive.

1. You enter a word (any language), the program looks at the ending letter.
2. If program knows a word that is starting with it, it replies you. Now it's your turn to do the same!
3. The one who cannot come up with any words anymore loses.
    
The program is not using any dictionary or spell check. If you enter a word that it doesn't know, it accepts it in case you allow it to save it to its dictionary. Next time it will use it against you! :)
